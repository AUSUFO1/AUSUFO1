### 💼 About Me

I'm a developer who's passionate about building mobile experiences that people actually enjoy using. My mission? To write **clean, scalable code** that solves real problems while continuously leveling up my skills.

- 🔭 Currently supporting the **National Gallery of Art** with Web Design and Management
- 💼 Web Developer & WordPress Manager at **IWeb.Ng** (4 years)
- 🚀 Focused on turning designs into polished, high-performance mobile applications
- 🎯 All about component-driven architecture, smooth animations, and pixel-perfect UIs
- 💬 Ask me about: **React Native, React.js, Mobile Development, API Integration**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe the best code is code that doesn't need a manual. But when it does, I write one.
